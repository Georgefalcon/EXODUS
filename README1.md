### DIGITAL BOOK SHELF
Here's a high-level breakdown of how you might structure your smart contract:

Student Registration:

When a student registers, the smart contract issues them three NFT cards and some tokens. This can be implemented using a function like registerStudent().
Borrowing Books:

Students can use their NFT cards to borrow books. Each NFT card represents the right to borrow one book. You'll need a function like borrowBook(uint256 nftCardId, uint256 bookId) to handle this.
Returning Books:

Students return books by returning the borrowed NFT card. You need a function like returnBook(uint256 nftCardId) to handle this. If a student returns the book late, you'll need to implement a penalty system.
Penalty System:

If a student returns the book late, they'll need to pay a penalty in tokens. You can implement a function like payPenalty(uint256 nftCardId) for this purpose. If the delay exceeds a certain threshold, the NFT card can be burnt.
NFT Management:

Implement functions to manage the creation, transfer, and burning of NFT cards.
Token Management:

Implement functions to manage the distribution and transfer of tokens.
Remember, this is just a high-level overview. You'll need to dive deeper into the specifics of each function and consider factors like security, efficiency, and usability. Additionally, you'll need to choose a suitable blockchain platform (such as Ethereum) and programming language (such as Solidity) for developing your smart contracts.

Great, let's focus on implementing the NFT generation, token generation, NFT card distribution, and token distribution functionalities in your blockchain-based library system. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can approach each of these tasks:

### Install
forge install openzeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts

NFT Generation:

Choose an NFT standard to use. ERC-721 is a popular standard for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on Ethereum.
Write a smart contract to define your NFTs. This contract should inherit from the ERC-721 standard and include any additional functionality you need, such as metadata.
Implement functions to mint NFTs. These functions will create new NFTs and assign ownership to specific addresses (e.g., students).
Token Generation:

Decide on the token standard to use. ERC-20 is a common standard for fungible tokens on Ethereum.
Write a smart contract to define your tokens. This contract should inherit from the ERC-20 standard and include any additional functionality you need, such as token supply and distribution rules.
Implement functions to mint tokens. These functions will create new tokens and assign them to specific addresses (e.g., students).
NFT Card Distribution:

After a student registers, call the NFT minting function to generate NFT cards for the student.
You may want to include additional metadata in the NFTs, such as student information or expiration dates.
Store information about which NFTs are owned by each student in your smart contract.
Token Distribution:

After a student registers, call the token minting function to generate tokens for the student.
Decide on the initial token distribution mechanism. For example, you could distribute tokens evenly to all registered students, or allocate tokens based on certain criteria such as academic performance.
Store information about token balances for each student in your smart contrac
